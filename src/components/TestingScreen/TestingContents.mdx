# Testing applications

## Additional tools

The Jest setup is enhanced with:

1. `@testing-library/react` provides selectors for testing elements like a user.
1. `@testing-library/react-hooks` provides utility fns for unit testing custom hooks.
1. `@testing-library/jest-dom` provides helpful matchers for component tests.
1. `jest-extended` provides helpful matchers for logic tests.

## VSCode

Commands to run the test suite, or a single test file are configured in the `launch.json`
configuration. The single file command is especially helpful for running tests with a
debugger.

The [Jest extension][extension] can be helpful when working on code coverage.

## Types

Types for Jest and the extended matchers are provided by installing `@types/jest`, and
importing the libraries into `src/@types/global.d.ts`.
