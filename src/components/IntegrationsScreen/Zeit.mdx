1. Set an `engines` in `package.json` to configure the version of Node.js used by the
   static builder
   ([Static Build Project Node.js Version](https://zeit.co/docs/builders#official-builders/static-builds/static-build-project-node-js-version))
2. Include build variables to prevent Cypress binary from being installed for faster
   builds.
   ([Cypress - Skipping Installation](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#Skipping-installation))
3. Add a route config for all resources to add a `cache-control` header for long term
   caching of webpack hashed build assets.
